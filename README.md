# 🏠 Nextion Home Automation System

A simple **home automation project** developed as part of my learning journey while working with the **Nextion TFT Touch Display** and Arduino.  
This project demonstrates how a graphical touch interface can be used to control home appliances.


## 📖 About the Project

This project was created while learning how to design user interfaces and communicate with a **Nextion TFT Touch Screen Display** using Arduino.  
The system allows the user to control home appliances through a touch-based UI designed on the Nextion display.

The main focus of this project is:
- Understanding **Nextion HMI design**
- Serial communication between **Arduino and Nextion**
- Basic **home automation logic**


## ✨ Features
